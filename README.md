# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Library

A **reference-quality collection** of data structures and algorithms, implemented from scratch with clean code, documentation, and tests.
This repository is not just about *toy implementations* — it’s engineered to be a **professional library** and a learning resource.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Robust, production-style implementations of core DSA
* ✅ Documented with explanations, use-cases, and complexity analysis
* ✅ Unit tests for reliability
* ✅ Example demos for practical usage
* ✅ Beginner → Advanced roadmap

## 📊 Complexity Tables

Each algorithm is documented with **time & space complexity** in `/docs/`.
Example:

| Algorithm     | Time Complexity             | Space Complexity |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Quick Sort    | O(n log n) avg, O(n²) worst | O(log n)         |
| Merge Sort    | O(n log n)                  | O(n)             |
| Binary Search | O(log n)                    | O(1)             |
